Objectives
1. Run an instance of JSON Server that hosts a dataset.
1. Make a GET request to display a dataset.
2. Make a POST request to add to that dataset.

*/

// Let's try making a GET request to display existing data on the page.
fetch("http://localhost:3000/candies")
.then(response => response.json())
.then(candies => {
    console.log(candies);
})
.catch(error => console.error(error));

fetch("http://localhost:3000/cookies/2")
.then(response => response.json())
.then(cookie => {
    console.log(cookie);
})
.catch(error => console.error(error));

// Now, let's trigger a POST request when the user submits the form,
// so that they can add data to the database! Remember to think about
// the event, the target, and the handler when planning a listener.


// ~ Challenges
// 1. There are a handful of awfully similar lines in our requests. Try abstracting them
//    into a function!
// 2. Try writing your own POST request.
// 3. Try writing PATCH and DELETE requests!
