  Core Deliverables
  1. Write a preamble that lets the browser know that this document's type is HTML.
  2. Write an <html> element consisting of a <head> and <body>.
  3. Link this file to `index.js`, so that the browser loads that file **after** loading the <body>.
  (Bonus 1) Link this file to `styles.css`, and apply some styles to elements on this page.
