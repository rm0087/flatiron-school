  A webpage, in its simplest form, is a structured list of visual and non-visual **elements** meant to
  be consumed by people like you and me on the World Wide Web. In November 1993, a few such elements
  were specified, like headers, paragraphs, and lists. Each element was given an abbreviation, e.g.
  <h1> for primary headers and <p> for paragraphs, and a syntax was formed for specifying an element's
  **attributes** and **content**. Thus came about the advent of Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML,
  the world's common format for describing the contents of a webpage. 
  
  An **HTML document** represents a webpage's elements with **tags**, in the following ways:
   (a) <tag>body</tag> (an opening tag, content, and a closing tag),
   (b) <tag/> (an empty, self-closing tag),
   (c) <tag attribute(s)> (an empty, implicity-closed tag with attributes),
   (d) <tag attribute(s)/> (a self-closing tag with attributes),
   (e) <tag attribute(s)></tag>, (an empty tag with attributes)
   (f) <tag attribute(s)>body</tag> (an opening tag with attributes, content, and a closing tag)

  A <tag> is used to "open" an element, like a paragraph with <p>.
  A closing </tag> is used to "close" an element, like a paragraph with </p>.
  An **attribute** describes a feature of an element, like an image's source with <img src="source">.

  The **content**, or the stuff between an opening <tag> and closing </tag>, is an element's **children**.
  An element's children can be one or more other elements, onscreen text, or a combination of both.
  For example, <p>This is an <em>important</em> paragraph.</p> denotes a paragraph with both
  element-based (<em>important</em>) and text-based ("This is an " and " paragraph.") children. 

  **Void elements** cannot have children, e.g. <img src="images.com/apple.png" />.
  Trailing /s in opening tags like the one above are actually ignored by HTML **parsers**, but we
  often include them for readability and compatibility with HTML addons. 

  Whereas elements describe the structure of our webpage, **comments** like this introductory blurb
  are a language-agnostic, developer construct. Comment syntax varies from language to language;
  in HTML, we surround comments with [less than symbol]!-- and --[greater than symbol].
  In many **Integrated Development Environments**, we can use the shortcut Ctrl+/ or Cmd+/ to (un)comment
  selected text. 

  With all that ado out of the way, let's take a look at our first HTML document!
-->

<!-- This tag tells your browser to follow the official HTML spec when interpreting your document. -->
<!-- It's so important that it gets its own term: it's your document's **preamble**! -->
<!-- Preambles are **void**, meaning we won't be pairing this line with content or a closing tag. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- The <html> element isn't technically required, but is strongly recommended as the best way to -->
<!-- inform browsers and users of your content's language. We do so by setting the `lang` attribute! -->
<html lang="en">
  <!--
  The <head> element is not void, and contains as its children a document's non-visual elements,
  like its title, styles, scripts, favicons, and metadata.
  -->
  <head>
    <title>HTML and JS: A Primer</title>
    <!--
      JavaScript (JS) is a language, like HTML, built with a different purpose in mind: adding
      interactivity to webpages. To link some JS to this document, we'll want to:
        (a) Create a new file on our machine with the .js extension, e.g. index.js.
        (b) Write a <script> element in our <head> to associate this document with that file.
      
      A <script> should go in the <head> of an HTML document, since it is inherently non-visual.
      We'll often want to add two attributes to our <script> tags:
        (a) src: The path to our file, e.g. "index.js".
        (b) defer: This tells our browser to run the <script> only after the entire webpage has loaded.
            Note: You may see "DOMContentLoaded" and "load" being used for the same purpose.

      Also note, <script> is a non-void element, so we'll need a closing </script>.
    -->
    <script defer src="./index.js"></script>
    <!--
      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is yet another language, like HTML and JS, built for yet
      another purpose: controlling how a webpage **looks**. To link a CSS **stylesheet* to this document,
      we'll want to:
          (a) Create a new file on our machine with the .css extension, e.g. styles.css.
          (b) Write a <link> element in our <head> to associate this document with that file.

      A CSS <link> should go in the <head> of an HTML document, since styles aren't actually
      printed onto the page (they affect the page, but aren't written onto the page).
      We'll set the `rel` attribute to "stylesheet" to denote an association to a CSS file,
      and set the `href` attribute to either an absolute or relative path to the file.

      N.B. <link> is a void element, so it cannot have children.
    -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />
  </head>

  <!-- The <body> contains as its children a document's visual elements, e.g. text, images, etc. -->
  <body>
